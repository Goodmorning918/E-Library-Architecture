== Cart Processes

This section covers key processes involved in managing the cart, including adding items, removing items, finalizing the cart, and updating the cart status upon payment.

[%collapsible]
====
The *Add Item to Cart* process allows a user to add a selected item to their cart. This process involves communication between the frontend Cart SPA and the backend Cart Microservice, which stores the cart data in the Cart Database.

.[.collapse-title]#Remove item from cart#
[%collapsible]
====
The *Remove Item from Cart* process enables users to remove an item from their cart. The Cart Microservice processes the request and updates the Cart Database accordingly, reflecting the change in the frontend Cart SPA.

.[.collapse-title]#Finalize cart#
[%collapsible]
====
The *Finalize Cart* process initiates checkout, where the Cart Microservice verifies item availability, calculates totals, and interacts with the Finance Microservice to generate a payment link. The Cart SPA displays this link to the user for completing the purchase.

.[.collapse-title]#Cart paid#

====
The *Cart Paid* process updates the cart status after payment is confirmed. The Finance Microservice notifies the Cart Microservice, which marks the cart as paid in the Cart Database and updates the status in the Cart SPA.
