== Product Processes

This section covers key processes involved in managing library items, including adding new books, removing books, and presenting available items to users.

The *Add Book to Library* process enables administrators to add a new book to the library’s catalog. The Products SPA sends the details to the Products Microservice, which stores the information in the Products Database.

.[.collapse-title]#Remove book from library#
[%collapsible]
====
The *Remove Book from Library* process allows administrators to remove an item from the catalog. The Products SPA requests the removal, and the Products Microservice updates the Products Database to reflect the change.

====
The *Present Available Books* process provides users with a view of all available books in the library. The Products SPA retrieves this data from the Products Microservice, which accesses the Products Database to display an up-to-date list of items.
